<br>

## General info
- Make sure `words` folder is in the same directory as the game
- **Custom languages** can be added by editing `.words` files
<br>

## How to use:
  - Double click for the `.exe` file
  - Double click or `java -jar imspeed.jar` for the `.jar` file
  - Optionally use `--log` argument if something doesn't work
<br>

## Sidenotes
- `.exe` file is in fact a wrapped jar, allowing for the icon and to run the program with a double-click.
- Versions **below 2.x** will no longer load fonts correctly, you have to place them manually in `%appdata%\imspeed\fonts` (or just use a newer version)
